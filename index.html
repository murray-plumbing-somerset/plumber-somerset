      <section aria-label="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Plumbing service in Somerset typically centers on maintaining safe water delivery, reliable drainage, and functional fixtures across a mix of newer and older residential systems. Field work commonly includes diagnosing leaks, resolving drainage restrictions, restoring pressure stability, and repairing or replacing worn components that affect performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Local conditions can influence plumbing behavior in foothill communities. Aging pipe materials, intermittent pressure patterns, and site-specific factors such as terrain, access, and vegetation can complicate diagnosis and repair planning. A technical approach prioritizes confirming root cause before selecting a repair method that fits the system configuration and the property’s constraints.

      <section aria-label="Key Terminology">
        <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Cleanout</dt>
          <dd>An access point that allows inspection and service of a drain or sewer line without removing fixtures or opening walls.</dd>

          <dt>Static Water Pressure</dt>
          <dd>The measured pressure in a water supply line when no fixtures are running, used to evaluate system baseline conditions.</dd>

          <dt>Root Intrusion</dt>
          <dd>Entry of tree or shrub roots into a sewer or drain line through joints or defects, often contributing to recurring blockages.</dd>

          <dt>Trap Seal</dt>
          <dd>The water barrier inside a plumbing trap that prevents sewer gases from entering the occupied space.</dd>

          <dt>Dielectric Union</dt>
          <dd>A fitting used to separate dissimilar metals to reduce galvanic corrosion at connection points.</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section aria-label="Process and Diagnostics">
        <h2>Process &amp; Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>
          Plumbing diagnostics typically begin with symptom mapping—identifying which fixtures are affected, when the issue presents, and whether it is isolated or system-wide. Inspection then targets likely failure points such as joints, valves, supply transitions, or drain intersections. Testing methods may include pressure evaluation, controlled flow tests, and localized checks to confirm the failure location before repair work is started.

      <section aria-label="Technical Standards and Local Context">
        <h2>Technical Standards &amp; Local Context</h2>
        <p>
          Plumbing work in and around Somerset may involve permitting and inspection considerations depending on the scope of work, especially when modifying building systems or replacing major components. Documentation expectations typically include a clear description of the work performed and confirmation that installed components match intended use and compatibility requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          For regional permitting and inspection guidance commonly referenced for building work, consult the official Sacramento County Building Permits and Inspection resource:
